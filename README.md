This is a copy of the main repository I worked in for CS4500, Software Development. We were required to use school github accounts that I no longer have access to, but in the interest of showing what I've worked on, I've uploaded the files here so they can be viewed.

The main project is Snarl (Snarl is Not A Rogue Like), which is a top-down rogue like game. 1-4 players must navigate through a maze made of rooms and hallways with limited vision to find a key and escape through a door while avoiding enemies. The graphics are simple command line ASCII. The game can be played locally or with a server-client connection, where one machine hosts the game and other machines can connect and play.
