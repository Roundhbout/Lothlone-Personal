class Level:
    """
    Class to represent a Level in the game. Contains the rooms and hallways of the level, and all the objects in it

    Parameters:
        rooms (list): list of rooms in the level.
        hallways (list): list of hallways in the level.
        objects (list): list of objects in the level. These arent represented in the grid, but get added when rendered
        bounds (tuple): A (row, col) tuple representing the size of the grid
        grid (list): A list of lists of chars (soon to be tiles) indicating the layout of the level. Formed based on the 
            rooms and hallways
    
    Methods:
        add_object(object): add an object to the list of objects
        remove_object(object): remove an object from the list of objects
        get_neighbors(grid, coord, cardinal): not a part of the class, but it's helpful. Returns all
            neighboring coordinates of coord in grid. Returns only cardinal neighbors if cardinal is True.
